**Before (No ads showing):**
```
250 visitors × 0 ad impressions = $0.00/day
Result: $0.01 in 2 weeks (basically nothing)
```

**After (3 ads per page):**
```
250 visitors × 3 pages × 3 ads = 2,250 impressions
2,250 × $3 RPM = $6.75/day
Result: $202/month instead of $0.01!
```

**That's a 20,000X improvement!** 🚀
